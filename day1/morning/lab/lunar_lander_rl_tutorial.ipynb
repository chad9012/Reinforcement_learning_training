        "\n",
        "1. **🏗️ MDP Components in Practice:**\n",
        "   - **States**: 8-dimensional continuous space (position, velocity, angle, etc.)\n",
        "   - **Actions**: 4 discrete actions (engines: none, left, main, right)\n",
        "   - **Rewards**: Continuous rewards based on landing performance\n",
        "   - **Transitions**: Physics-based state changes\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **🎲 Baseline Performance:**\n",
        "   - Random agents perform poorly (~0-20% success rate)\n",
        "   - Demonstrates the need for intelligent decision-making\n",
        "   - Shows the challenge of the environment\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **🎮 Human Intelligence:**\n",
        "   - Manual control significantly outperforms random actions\n",
        "   - Demonstrates the value of strategy and planning\n",
        "   - Shows what RL algorithms should aspire to achieve\n",
