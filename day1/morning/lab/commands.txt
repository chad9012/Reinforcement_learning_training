Explanation of each command:

1.cd
Changes the current directory to your home directory. This ensures all files are downloaded and installed in a safe and predictable location.

2.curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
Downloads the Anaconda installer script for Linux (version 2024.10-1) into your current directory.
-O saves the file with its original filename (Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh).

3.bash ~/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
Executes the installer script using bash. This will launch the Anaconda installation wizard in the terminal, where youâ€™ll be asked to review the license and confirm installation settings.

4.source ~/.bashrc
Reloads your shell configuration to activate the Anaconda environment paths that were added by the installer (e.g., adding Anaconda to your PATH environment variable).

5.conda list
Verifies that Anaconda is installed correctly by listing all the installed Python packages in the base Conda environment.
